The First Days at Home,Common mistakes new owners make,Reading (article),5–10 minutes,Days 1–30,This module highlights the most common early mistakes owners make and how to avoid them.,"Many early problems come from misunderstandings rather than intentional errors. This module explains mistakes like overstimulation, giving too much freedom too soon, inconsistent rules, allowing unwanted behaviours to develop, reinforcing anxiety or whining, and relying on punishment. By becoming aware of these patterns, owners can prevent problems instead of fighting them later, making the entire training journey smoother and kinder for the dog.",Read through common mistakes.,Notice which ones you might be doing.,Adjust your routines and boundaries.,Improve consistency across the household.,Revisit this module regularly during the first month.,"Carefully read a list of typical early mistakes such as letting the dog roam unsupervised, picking them up every time they cry, or allowing jumping because they are “still a puppy.”",Reflect honestly on which of these might already be happening in your home and how they could affect your dog’s long-term behaviour.,"Make concrete changes to your routines: use more management (gates and pens), add structure to rest and play, and stop unintentionally rewarding behaviours you do not want.","Share these insights with all family members so everyone responds to the dog in the same way, making learning clear and predictable.","Revisit this module regularly in the first month as habits form, using it as a self-check tool to keep your training and handling on track."

Training Introduction: Setting the Owner Up for Success,Understanding how dogs learn,"Reading (article + video, if available)",10–15 minutes,Week 1–2,"This module explains the basic science of how dogs learn, so owners understand why training works the way it does.","In this module, you will learn that dogs learn through associations and consequences in the moment. You will discover how reinforcement strengthens behaviours, why timing and consistency matter so much, and how a dog’s emotional state affects their ability to learn. We also cover key concepts like thresholds and arousal, and the difference between shaping, capturing, and luring behaviours. With this foundation, training stops feeling like guesswork and becomes a clear, fair communication system between you and your dog.",Read the overview of learning theory.,Learn about timing and consequences.,Understand the role of emotions and arousal.,"Compare shaping, capturing, and luring.",Reflect on how your own actions influence behaviour.,Start by reading about the basic learning principles: dogs repeat behaviours that are rewarded and avoid behaviours that lead to unpleasant outcomes or no benefit.,"Learn that timing is critical—dogs connect rewards or consequences with what happened in the last one or two seconds, not what happened minutes earlier.","Explore how your dog’s emotional state (calm, excited, fearful) can either open the door to learning or shut it down entirely; a relaxed, curious dog learns much faster than a frightened or frantic one.","Study the three main ways of teaching new behaviours: capturing (rewarding when the dog does it naturally), shaping (rewarding tiny steps toward the final behaviour), and luring (using food or a target to guide the dog into position), and note when each is most useful.","Reflect on your daily interactions and recognise that your dog is always learning from you—every treat, every bit of attention, and every situation you manage or ignore teaches your dog what works in your shared world."
